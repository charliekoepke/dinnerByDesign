            <h2 style="margin: 1em;">How Cooking for Myself Changed My Life</h2>
            <p style="margin: 1em;">Like many life stories in this day of age, my cooking journey took off during the pandemic.  In a time when nothing was certain, I could always rely on the food I made to taste good, and bring me joy.  I started treating each time I cooked as practice, with the understanding that time spent would not be time wasted because I was developing a skill that would last my lifetime.  I eventually became so passionate about how much joy my food was bring me, that I decided to share what I was making on social media @samias.eats, and have since accumulated over 34,000 followers. I have also started cooking professionally in restaurants.  I don’t expect you to become an expert, but I hope Dinner By Design can help you to take actionable steps towards using cooking as a tool to prioritize self care, and to get off of the apps, and into the kitchen.</p>

            <h2 style="margin: 1em;">Cultivate Your cooking</h2>
            <p style="margin: 1em;">Cooking is a fundamentally human activity that has been practiced for thousands of years. and many people find that it comes naturally to them. People often learn cooking by observing others and imitating their techniques, which is how traditional cooking methods and recipes have been passed down through generations. Our video recipes provide clear demonstrations so you can see exactly how each ingredient needs to be prepared. Cooking is a trial and error process, involving experimentation with new flavors and ingredients, adapting recipes to individual preferences. As you cook from these recipes, feel free to improvise based on the ingredients in your home. Don’t forget to taste as you go, and adjust your seasonings to find the balance that suites your palette.</p>
